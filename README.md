# macro-tcc-configs

This repository tracks config files and scripts needed on the MACRO telescope control computer (TCC).
The root of this repository is _D:\RLMT_, which is also the [pyscope](https://github.com/macro-consortium/pyscope) telhome directory.
Files in the root directory and the _config_ subdirectory are tracked, but all other
subdirectories (i.e. _images_, _schedules_) are ignored.

Significant changes to these files on the TCC should be committed and pushed to this repo.
This can be done easily with VSCode.
